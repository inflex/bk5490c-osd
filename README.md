# B&K 5490C series benchtop OSD software

Development funded by Quenten Ciurro - Thankyou!

Simple Windows On-Screen-Display software for the B&K 549X series bench meters.  Great for using with OpenBroadcaster when capturing video.

Utilises hotkeys to permit you to change modes even when the OSD is not focused
